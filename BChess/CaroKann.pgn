{Welcome to my 2021 updated Caro-Kann course! In our introductory file I would
like to give you an overview of our repertoire. This is not a comprehensive
file of every single line, rather it can serve you as a roadmap as to White's
and Black's options. I will also outline where I present several options for
Black and my thoughts on how you can pick your preferred lines.} 1. e4 c6 {
Here we go! Our idea is to occupy the center with c6-d5 and adopt a light
square strategy. By attacking White's e4 pawn we also strive to give our Bc8 a
home on f5 square, although as we will see we don't always utilize the
possibility.} 2. d4 {Surely the best move for White is to occupy the center
but he also has some other viable options} (2. Nc3 d5 3. Nf3 {Is a very
popular and sound variation known as the "Two Knights." This variation has
seen a surge of popularity in the last years as it has been recommended in
several White repertoires and new ideas have been found.} Bg4 {is the solid
and most popular move. The main line goes} (3... dxe4 {Capturing on e4 seeks
to transpose to positions seen in the Tartakower Classical variation (see main
line) which have been revived with new ideas for Black in recent years.} 4.
Nxe4 Nf6) (3... a6 {This little pawn nudge is roughly 50x less popular than
the main move 3..Bg4 so it contains great surprise value. It also scores 56%
for Black! We are making a small useful waiting move to control the b5 square
and considering playing Bg4 at a more opportune moment.}) 4. h3 Bxf3 5. Qxf3 e6
{[%csl Gb7,Gc1,Gc6,Gd5,Ge6,Gf1,Gf7] Where White is happy to get the bishop
pair but Black is very solid and puts the pawns on the light squares. There
have been many setups tried for White here but I have an offbeat suggestion
for Black involving a Kingside fianchetto:}) (2. Nf3 d5 3. exd5 cxd5 4. d4 {
is an offshoot type of Exchange Variation of the Caro. White goes for simple
development but lets Black do the same. The resulting middgames are give us
comfortable play as I will show in the files.}) (2. c4 {is known as the
"Pseudo-Panov" and after} d5 3. exd5 cxd5 4. cxd5 (4. d4 {is the Panov}) 4...
Nf6 {White has some options to try to cause trouble before Black collects the
pawn back and short castles. With knowledge of a few key lines Black will
emerge in good shape. I would say this line is not really seen much nowadays
and is not popular at club level, although it is completely respectable.}) (2.
d3 {is a "KIA" (Kings Indian Attack) setup which of course will have it's
Kings Indian fans. I've definitely seen it a fair bit online and several times
OTB but we will get a good game by taking over the center} d5 3. Nd2 e5) 2...
d5 3. Nc3 {Protecting the pawn with Nc3/Nd2 is known as the "Classical"
variation. Nothing more classical than developing a piece and protecting the
center! This variation remains extremely popular but in my opinion is not as
challenging as the Advance variation (3. e5).} (3. Nd2 dxe4 {Will transpose to
3. Nc3}) (3. e5 $1 {I believe that the Advance Variation may be the "best"
line at White's disposal. The idea is clear: grab the space! Now the main move
is 3...Bf5, a move that is certainly very adequate and developing. However, I
am rolling with the less popular 3..c5!} c5 $5 4. dxc5 $1 {This greedy move is
considered critical. White grabs the pawn and dares Black to retrieve it!} (4.
c3 {This is a very important move to analyze. Although 4. dxc5! is arguable
most challenging, 4. c3 is roughly 3x more popular at the club level. However
this move is not so tough as it allows Black a version of a "good french".
Something like:} Nc6 5. Nf3 Bg4 6. Be2 e6 {[%csl Rd4,Gg4][%cal Gd8b6,Gg8h6,
Gg8e7,Ge7f5,Gh6f5] is an example! The position has a French structure (e4 e6
d4 d5 e5 c5) with the key distinction of Black's Bc8 being active on g4! This
is another reason I am happy to recommend 3..c5: many opponents will
unwittingly allow us this juicy continuation.}) (4. c4 $5 {is an aggressive
option}) 4... Nc6 $5 {This is the ambitious way to continue. We refuse to
close the Bc8! I think that unless White has deep theoretical knowledge of the
position then Nc6 would be my choice (and has been vs several master+ players).
However White does have some challenging retorts that we need to deal with.} (
4... e6 {is a solid alternative})) (3. exd5 cxd5 4. Bd3 {[%cal Gc1f4,Gc2c3,
Gb1d2,Gg1f3] This is the "Exchange Variation" and is a very popular line with
Masters and Amateurs alike. It is also a very frequent guest in online play.
The allure of this line for White is the promise of a simple developmental
setup with potential attacking chances.} (4. c4 {This is the "Panov-Botvinnik
Attack." This variation often gives rise to the famous "IQP" (Isolated Queen's
Pawn) structures that has been debating and analyzed endlessly over the past
century. There isn't anything particularly wrong with this line for White in
my view its popularity has been dwindling. I used to place it in the "Big
Four" of Classical, Advance, and Exchange variations but I think now the Two
Knights is more popular. Anyway, my main recommendation is the g6 fianchetto
which can be very unpleasant for White to face if he is unprepared (a common
issue here for club/amateur players!). My surprise recommendation is one that
I've used successfully myself and will either give you a second option or you
can even make it your main idea!} Nf6 5. Nc3 g6 {My preference. By
fianchettoing our Bf8 we keep the Bc8 open and also seek to put additional
pressure onto the d4 pawn.} (5... Nc6 6. Nf3 (6. Bg5 Ne4 $5 {This line can
lead to very dynamic play}) 6... Be6 {Surprise! This quirky move seeks to
resolve the pressure on the d5 pawn and force White to make a decision.}) 6.
Nf3 (6. Qb3 $1 Bg7 7. cxd5 {is the main and critical line. We sacrifice a pawn
but will try to collect it back in the future! Again as I have said about
several of the lines in this overview, this is a line that either a Master or
well prepared opponent will use. Of course I have analyzed this idea deeply to
give you good retorts in either case. Nevertheless if you are facing an
unprepared or amateur opponent then the inferior 6. Nf3?! will be seen more
often!}) 6... Bg7 7. Be2 O-O 8. O-O dxc4 9. Bxc4 Nc6 {[%csl Rd4][%cal Gg7d4,
Gc6d4,Gd8d4,Gc8g4,Gb7b6,Gc8b7] is a pleasant anti-IQP position!}) 4... Nc6 5.
c3 Nf6 (5... Qc7 {[%cal Rc1f4] This main line option prevents Bf4 and has
generally scored very strongly for Black.}) 6. Bf4 Bg4 {continues simple
development and usuall White wil try to attack our kingside while we storm the
queenside} (6... g6 $5 {This was the first line I learned vs the Exchange I
really liked and have shown it to many of my students. The resulting positions
are easy to play and White is often unsure how to meet them. Definitely
recommend this line for u2200 play:} 7. Nd2 Bg7 8. Ngf3 O-O 9. O-O Bf5 10. Bxf5
gxf5 {Black scores 56% here. We will occupy e4 and perhaps use the g-file to
attack})) (3. f3 {This is the "Fantasy Variation". This can be a very
unpleasant line to face without preparation as White seeks to have a big
center and attack/squash us.} e6 {Keeping things nice and solid, frustrating
White.} (3... e5 $5 {A violent counterattacking gambit!} 4. dxe5 Bc5 {[%csl
Re1]}) 4. Nc3 Qb6 $5 {Bringing the queen out early but placing annoying
pressure on the d4/b2 pawns. This move has scored excellently for Black but is
not very popular. That is a perfect repertoire weapon for my checklist!}) 3...
dxe4 4. Nxe4 Nf6 {This variation has been around for a while but perhaps did
not enjoy the best reputation as Black is seemingly doubling his pawns for no
gain. However it is apparent nowadays that such thinking was too simplistic
and Nf6 is enjoying a big surge in popularity. I definitely think this is the
move to learn as your main weapon.} (4... Bf5 {This is the main move and is
known as the Capablanca variation. This move is perfectly fine and I have
played it myself for many years and many games} 5. Ng3 Bg6 {White actually has
a lot of pesky sideline setups here but we will just overview the main line} 6.
h4 h6 7. Nf3 e6 $5 {is very interesting and a modern twist. Black doesn't mind
allowing Ne5 and also hopes that the Nb8 may jump to c6 instead in the future.
I think Black is doing fine after Nd7 as well but White may be less prepared
to deal with this modern try} (7... Nd7 {This is the very well explored "old
main line" and often times the opening moves are blitzed here} 8. h5 Bh7 9. Bd3
Bxd3 10. Qxd3 e6 11. Bd2 Ngf6 12. O-O-O Be7 13. Kb1 O-O 14. Ne4 Nxe4 15. Qxe4
Nf6 16. Qe2 Qd5 {While both sides had deviations along the way, this is really
the main line with 750 games played. Again I should say that this "Old Main
Line" is fine for black but has arguably been better trodden than the paths of
7..e6!? or the earlier 4... Nf6 Tartakower.})) 5. Nxf6+ {Really this makes the
most sense but of course we will look at alternatives in the main file.} exf6
$1 {[%cal Gf8d6,Gc8e6,Ge8g8,Gb8d7] As mentioned, Black does get doubled pawns
but now development will flow as free as water. Often times Black will also
get attacking chances on the Kingside by pointing his pieces there and
potentially even sacrificing and pawn storming!} 6. Nf3 {An unprepared
opponent is way more likely to develop naturally as such and the resulting
positions will give Black excellent play and activity. Although I don't think
Nf3 is the best move it is still important to learn and understand the
resulting positions for Black.} (6. c3 {This move, or rather the setup that
follows, has been established as White's most testing idea. Many experienced
players may know this from reviewing their openings but it is very rare for an
unprepared player to play this idea at the board.} Bd6 7. Bd3 O-O 8. Qc2 Re8+
9. Ne2 {Now Black has to make a decision regarding protecting the h7 pawn.
This variation was considered better for White for many years but recently has
been a fertile battle ground for many Grandmasters as Black discovered the idea
} h5 $1 {This move was first played in 2014 but did not recieve attention
until it was repeated in 2017 by several Grandmasters. Since then hundreds of
games have tested this move and it is firmly the main line. The idea in a
nutshell is to get the pawn out of harm's way and often times push it to h4.
The subtleties will be further explored in the Tartakower file. Now White has
a choice: castle long or short? With a few key ideas, Black's game will be
easy to handle regardless and I believe this is an excellent repertoire option
for spirited play}) 6... Bd6 7. h3 O-O 8. Be2 Re8 9. O-O Be6 10. Be3 Nd7 11.
Qd2 Nf8 12. Rfe1 Qd7 13. Rad1 Bxh3 $1 14. gxh3 Qxh3 $19 {[%cal Ge8e4,Ge4g4] is

{We will examine an instructive game in the Exchange Caro Kann (ECK). The ECK
is a popular approach from White who hopes to play natural developing moves
and get a kingside attack. This variation leads to the important pawn
structure known as the "Carlsbad Structure." For now, we will look at a
slightly unusual approach from Black involving a kingside fianchetto.} 1. e4 c6
2. d4 d5 3. exd5 cxd5 4. Bd3 {[%cal Gc2c3,Gc1f4,Gg1f3,Gb1d2] This is the
Exchange Caro. White wants to play: C3, Nf3, Nd2, Bf4, 0-0, Re1, Ne5 and get
some kingside attack.} Nc6 5. c3 Nf6 6. Bf4 (6. Nf3 {Experienced White ECK
players will often delay Nf3 to prevent us from pinning the Knight. We can
continue with the fianchetto or take the opportunity to play Bg4} Bg4 {[%cal
Ge7e6,Gf8e7,Ge7d6,Ge8g8,Ga8b8,Gb7b5,Gg4h5,Gh5g6] The plan for Black: e6, Be7/
Bd6, 0-0 and start a pawn minority attack on the queenside with b5-b4 (often
supported by Rb8). The Bg4 can drop back to h5-g6 to defend the Kingside and
nullify the strong Bd3}) 6... g6 $5 {This is the first idea I ever used
against the ECK. It somewhat cuts across White's plans of a kingside attack by
blunting the Bd3. Therefore, we make White's task trickier because he can't
rely on the same ideas. Futhermore, the main idea is actually the sneaky move
Bf5!} 7. Nf3 Bg7 8. O-O O-O 9. Nbd2 {White is finishing up his setup.} Bf5 $1 {
Our main idea! Now White almost always plays} 10. Bxf5 gxf5 {At first it looks
like Black has used a terrible plan: He has weakened his King's position and
ruined his pawn structure. Actually, both of these "disadvantages" are going
to be Black's advantages (or he hopes!). The King is actually not weak, but
Black will try to attack with Kh8 and Rg8! And the pawn structure is actually
not damaged, but instead Black gains more control over the center and
especially the e4 square. Let's have a quick look at how a Grandmaster used
these ideas to score an emphatic win.} 11. Ne5 Nxe5 12. Bxe5 e6 13. Nf3 Kh8 $1
{Getting ready to play Rg8 and then Ne4!} 14. Qb3 Qe7 15. c4 $6 {I don't like
this move for White because now he has an isolated pawn and Black gains the d5
outpost for his pieces.} dxc4 16. Qxc4 Rg8 17. Rac1 Nd5 18. Qc5 Qe8 19. Bxg7+
Rxg7 {I really like Black's position and his plans are also very easy to
follow. He is simply building up on the g-file.} 20. Rc2 f6 $1 {Taking control
of the e5 square and preparing Qh5. A key rule of attacking: Bring all your
pieces into the attack!!} 21. Rfc1 Qh5 22. Qa3 Rag8 23. g3 Qh3 {Black has a
lot of pressure against White's king. How should he break through?} 24. Qd6 f4
$1 {Another key principle of attacking: Open files so that your pieces can
invade!} 25. Rc8 fxg3 26. Rxg8+ Rxg8 27. fxg3 (27. hxg3 Ne3 $1) 27... Ne3 28.
Kf2 Ng4+ 29. Kg1 Nxh2 $3 {Open files for your pieces to invade!!} 30. Kf2 Ng4+
31. Kg1 {0-1 (31) Masternak,G (2320)-Malisauskas,V (2505)/ Mikolajki 1991/
White resigned before Black can put up the finishing touches with:} e5 $1 {
Summary: The Exchange Caro is a popular option for White who just wants to
follow a simple development scheme and attack the Kingside. We will cut across
these plans with a solid Kingside fianchetto followed by the quirky Bf5! In
the resulting pawn structure, Black has a stronghold on the central light
squares and the key plan of attacking along the g-file.} *

{This file is about the Panov-Botvinnik Attack (PBA). It is a reasonably
popular option for White on all levels, especially scholastic. White is aiming
for an attacking IQP structure where he will rely on the activity of his
pieces as well as many well tested maneuvers to attack our king. To cut across
White's plans, I'm recommending the less popular approach of a Kingside
Fianchetto. The fianchetto setup I am going to show is considered the BEST way
to set up against an IQP structure (more on that below) but it works best when
White doesn't know the most testing anti-fianchetto idea} 1. e4 c6 2. d4 d5 3.
exd5 cxd5 4. c4 {This is the PBA. White is putting pressure against the center
and wishes to reach the famous IQP structure.} Nf6 5. Nc3 g6 $5 {If we can get
away with setting up a fianchetto system, then we are going to be doing very
well. First of all, our kingside will be very secure against White's attacking
attempts (usually done with a battery Bc2-Qd3) . Second, our Bg7 will not only
be a powerful defender but also will exert great pressure against the d4
weakness. Finally, since we have not played e6 our Bc8 will be free to wander 
(although we can put it on b7 as well). Futhermore, I am also a fan of this
system since it is not well known by our opponents and their usual plans don't
work against it (you will see I have great emphasis on the practical
applicability of our openings!).} 6. Nf3 $6 {This perfectly natural developing
move is already inaccurate. This move looks very natural and it is very
popular. That is great news for us! The reason it is not precise is because it
doesn't disturb our position at all. If we get our desired setup in, then
White will feel the pain of the weakness of d4.} (6. Qb3 $1 {This is the BEST
move for White and it's annoying because they want to win our pawn! There is
no good way to defend so it we are going to sacrifice it...but aim to get it
back in the future (and win our nice IQP position).} Bg7 7. cxd5 O-O 8. Be2 {
[%cal Ge2f3,Gg1e2,Ge2f4] White is going to do his best to defend d5, Black is
going to do his best to win it back. This is a critical variation, but to be
honest I would advise focusing on the BOLDED line more because it will be more
popular in your games for now. However we will explore this variation later
and of course especially if you start facing it a lot. I have attached a good
example of Black's strategy:} Nbd7 9. Bf3 Nb6 10. Nge2 Bg4 $1 {Getting rid of
a defender of d5.} 11. Bxg4 Nxg4 12. O-O Nf6 13. Nf4 Qd7 14. Be3 Rfd8 {So

normally here} 7. Be2 O-O 8. O-O Nc6 9. h3 (9. c5 {This is an important move
to have a look at because some players make this pawn push in some positions.
Here White doesn't get an IQP but the d4 pawn is still exposed. Usually Black
can play moves like Bg4 putting pressure on it and sometimes striking in the
center with e5. However almost always the key response is:} Ne4 $1 {Unleashing

axb6 {White no longer has an IQP but his c3 and a2 pawns are weak which is
also a big problem. On top of that, Black also has great control over the
light squares (such as c4). Why is this so important? Because sometimes in
this variation Black makes a "Trade of Advantages." Sometimes it is a good
idea to take on c3 if you get something significant in return (like the
backwards c3 pawn and the c4 outpost)} 13. Qd2 Ba6 $1) 9... dxc4 $1 10. Bxc4 {
We have reached an IQP position..... the type of pawn structure White is going
for in the PBA. Except...this is the best possible version for Black! All our
pieces will soon find good squares and White will lack active play in return
for his structural concession (pawn on d4 is isolated). Black's main plans
here a mix: pressure the d4 pawn and play for the light squares on d5/c4. The
games below are important to study because they show how Black can slowly take
over the game and put White on the defensive. Here is Black's usual win
strategy: develop pieces on influential squares (that control light squares)
by playing b6-Bb7-Na5-Rc8-Nc4 (Nd5) (usually), followed by some combo of
Qd6+Rd8 (pressure d4) pawn....followed by favorable trades and winning the d4
pawn and then winning the endgame!} b6 $1 {I like this plan the best. Black is
going to place both bishops on the long diagonals, very influential} 11. Be3

that Black really enjoys using the outpost in front of the IQP.} 15. Bh6 Nxc3

actually not a lot to memorize....rather I wanted to show several very
instructive games that showcase Black's positional strategies in exploiting
the IQP as well as the light squares. The fianchetto option is very effective
because it cuts across White's standard ideas of a Kingside attack. On top of
that most players play the inspid Nf3 instead of Qb3 or cxd5. We have seen the
ideas Black should employ in the resulting IDEAL IQP: b6, Bb7, Na5/Nb4, Rc8
and make GOOD TRADES w/PRESSURE AGAINST d4!} *

{Time for a look at the Classical Variation. In response, we are going to play
the Tartakower Variation. In the Tartakower, we endure a slight positional
concession (doubled pawns) but in return we gain free and easy development.
Our main worry is the endgame where our double pawns will not let us make a
passed pawn. However in the middle game, these pawns provide strong cover for
our kingside and can often even be advanced forward to create an attack.} 1. e4

as some other ideas that include: Nd7-Nf8-Ng6. The idea of this maneuver is to
bring the knight to the Kingside (maybe h4 or f4 next) in order to start
probing/attacking. Also, pushing the Kingside pawns with g6+h5/f5 is on the
cards. Sometimes the move b5! is good too in order to take control of the
light squares.} (6. Nf3 Bd6 7. Bd3 O-O 8. O-O Re8 9. h3 {Both sides are

-Alexandrova,O (2427)/Warsaw POL 2013/ Summary: The Tartakower is a very easy
to play opening where we get free-flowing development. However, I am also
arming you with an active and potentially very effective plan: the Kingside
expansion! After developing your pieces (don't forget the common Nd7-Nf8
maneuver with ideas of Ne6/Ng6 but usually just to open up the rooks) look for
ways to push h5/f5 and either push your opponent's pieces back or force (light
square) weaknesses. Or both! Also keep in mind the shocking Bxh3! idea we saw
in the game above.} *

throw White off as he can't stick to his setup. Those in the know will play
Ne2+0-0 and maybe even Qe1. This is a tricky line so be prepared! 5..Nf6 is
the main line and here we have another split. Either you play the g6+bf5
approach in order to take over the g-file for an attack or continue in typical
style with Bg4. Now in the main line we have a very typical situation of
fending off White's aggression while pursuing our queenside pawn storm. In
general remember the Nf6/Nc6/Bg4/e6/Be7 (Bh5-g6) setup combined with a
queenside pawn storm and you can look to the middlegame with confidence!} *

Malmdin,N (2175)-Salem,A (2564)/Caleta ENG 2014/ Summary: Our last section
delt with many unusual options from White. Some I think are not good at all 
(B3, Bc4, Blackmar-Diemer) but others require some knowledge (Nf3+d3, Qe2/Qf3
& Ne2!?). In my experience 2. d3 is the most popular of the bunch but allows
us to take over the center. 2. Ne2!? is probably the trickiest as the
resulting positions are very confusing.} *
