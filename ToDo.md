#  BChess

Bug:
- UI: indication of mate or draw
- Better move list with a3xa5 when capture is made
- PGN copy/paste handling
- border around the board
- border at the bottom between the info line and the board

ToDo

- Time management
- Check how the best line is used (or maybe think about re-ordering the moves)
