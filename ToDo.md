#  BChess

Bug:
- castling: cannot castle when king in check or when a square is attacked! Have unit tests for all these scenarios
- doesn't seem to do pawn promotion with black
- UI: indication of mate or draw

ToDo

- Time management
- Check how the best line is used (or maybe think about re-ordering the moves)
